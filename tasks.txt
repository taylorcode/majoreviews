TODO
FIX the review averages thing
Need to do error states in UI ?
move other modules out of services

Chores:
Change the endpoint for post review/:id if necessary
Move the logic to methods?
Move the functions out of the scope of the container?
examing errHandler and see if they should be noDocErrorHandler or vice versa
make sure all functions do one thing
Validation augments for email checking, etc.
Convert everything to coffeeScript
Change grunt build process so it builds out coffeescript

Testing:
Test all endpoints through mrApi for proper error states
