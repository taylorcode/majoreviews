Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-delete-sync --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-delete-sync');\n```\n\nThis task looks through the files defined in `src`, if they do not exist in the `syncWith` directory, they are removed.\n\n\nExample:\n```js\ndelete_sync: {\n  dist: {\n\tcwd: 'targetDir',\n\tsrc: ['**', '!**/*.css'],\n\tsyncWith: 'src'\n  }\n},\n```\n",
